# Welcome to ChowChooser!

ChowChooser mitigates the headache of ordering food for large groups of people!

## How does it work?

Our lobby system allows users to vote on a list of restaurants instead of verbally debating each other for the best eatery in town.

Once a restaurant is chosen, users can place orders for various menu items from the restaurant.

At the end, the lobby admin can view everyone's orders as well as the group's cumulative total. It's that easy!

## Documentation

+ [Software requirements specification (SRS)](Documentation/srs.md)
