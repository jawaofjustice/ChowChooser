You'll first want to make sure to add the environmental variable:

	CHOWCHOOSER_P = OexDTUj@xd#^3CZm

Then, install the chowChooser admin user following the instructions in the User Setup folder.

Next, install the bash helper scripts following the instructions in the Helper Bash SCripts folder.

After that, load the latest chow_chooser.backup.{Date}.sql database dump.

Finally, you'll need to add the password to your envvars file for Apache. You should be able to find this under:

	For Linux:
		/etc/apache2
	
	For Windows:
		C:\Program Files\Apache
		
Just append this line to the end of your file:

	export CHOWCHOOSER_P=OexDTUj@xd#^3CZm
	
And finally reload apache:

	sudo service apache2 restart

Don't worry about sharing this pass to the repo for now, we'll take a more secure route in a later version.
