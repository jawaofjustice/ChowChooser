Hello. My name is Maryellen. This is my second to last semester here at WCC and I will be transfering to EMU. In my free time I like to spend time with my family, sing (just for fun), and I have many hobbies from board games to crocheting. Looking to network more as most of my time at WCC has been virtual due to Covid. It is really nice getting to see some people again and getting to know new ones. Looking forward to working together with everyone this semester. Thanks.
