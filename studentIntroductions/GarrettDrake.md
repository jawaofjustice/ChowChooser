# Garrett's self introduction

My name is Garrett! I go by massivebird on GitHub. I like programming in Rust, taking notes in Obsidian, playing Kim Possible 2 on the Gameboy Advance, and eating orzo salad from Costco. My favorite coding projects are command line applications; you can check some of them out on [my website](https://massivebird.github.io/about-me).
