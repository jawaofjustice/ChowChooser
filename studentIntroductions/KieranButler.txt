Hello! 

  I'm Kieran - I've lived in Michigan all my life, I'm an Ypsilanti local, and I have one more semester of college at WCC after this one. I have two adorable cats, I love to cook and bake, and I play a variety of PC games. I love DIY projects and learning in general. I've been meddling with code since I attended UofM's camp CAEN when I was in middle school. 
  
  I currently work for an apparel decorating shop that employs a significant amount of tech in all corners of the fulfillment process. It's been fascinating to see how certain aspects of software engineering and development are applied in a real world scenario, and I get cool shirts to boot. 

Thanks for reading my introduction!
