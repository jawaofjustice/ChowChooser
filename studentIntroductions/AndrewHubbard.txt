Hi, my name is Andrew Hubbard. I am 36 years old. I lived in Illinois until my family moved to Saline, Michigan, about 10 years ago. I earned a dual bachelor's degree in Math and Computer Science in 2009, and a master's degree in Mathematical Computer Science in 2012. After that I worked as a Healthcare Data Analyst from 2015 until 2022. I am trying to earn a certificate from WCC in Java and/or C++, so I can start a new career as a Software Developer. I also was the Michigan State chess champion in 2015, 2016, and 2017.
